# This is a A veryveryvery rough checklist for items to address in physically 
# securing a builing/campus. 
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Overview
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Here are some sample processes to consider using in developing your physical security program.

Security Hardening Process
	• Work with client to determine security budget for the next fiscal year
	• Interview client to determine which level of security they wish to meet (see pre-determined security levels in Physical Security Checklist)
	• Run through the Physical Security Checklist  to catalog current security posture
	• Determine which areas of Physical Security do not meet UpTime Security Standards for the security level chosen by the client
	• Create projects based on findings and assign estimated hours and cost required to complete each project
	• Present findings client
	• Work with client to prioritize projects based on budget and need

Application and File Security Levels:
	• Level 0 – Unclassified - Available for public use or consumption
	• Level 1 – Confidential – For use by company personnel, or authorized vendors/consultants
	• Level 2 – Secret – Company use only
	• Level 3 – Top Secret – Authorized company personnel only
 
Physical Security Levels
	• Level 0 – Public – Available to public traffic – Shipping and receiving, lobby, public conference room
	• Level 1 – Sensitive – For use by company personnel, or authorized vendors/consultants, and escorted visitors – work areas
	• Level 2 – Restricted - Company personnel only, or authorized vendors/consultants – wiring and utility closets, IDFs
	• Level 3 – Confidential - Authorized company personnel only – server room, MDF

Security Zones
	• Ring 0 - Areas on the perimeter of the business building
	• Ring 1 - Immediate area around the business building/environmental (fire, floods, moisture, power)
	• Ring 2 - Internal location of the business building
	• Ring 3 - Human factors

		RF Resistant Paint
			YShield High Frequency Shielding Paint
			Easy to apply water-based paint for walls, ceilings, doors and other interior OR exterior surfaces. Very effective for blocking cell phone signals, CB, TV, AM, FM signals, radiofrequency radiation and microwaves. Tested highly effective up to 18 GHz!
			Based on a high quality pure acrylic binder, this shielding paint offers a perfect compromise of excellent attenuation, high water resistance and good ecology. Good adhesion on many surfaces and substrates like latex paint, construction boards, cement, plaster, polystyrene, masonry surfaces, etc.
			
			
			Frost-resistant liquid format, ready to use right out of the bottle. Easy to handle – roll similar to ordinary wall paint - and still achieve an amazing reduction of 99% of HF-Radiation with only one layer. Dries quickly. Water clean-up.
			Due to its holohedral carbon structure, without fibers or meshes, it offers consistent attenuation regardless of the direction of signal polarization, and a highly conductive surface. As a bonus, carbon is a good RF absorber. About 10% of Y-Shield shielding effectiveness is due to absorption. This helps reduce reflections and minimizes the risk from RF sources trapped inside the shielded area.

			Ground Kit for Y-Shield
			Specially designed for grounding indoor flat surfaces like walls painted with Y-Shield. Provides secure connection. Connect to surface after Y-Shield has dried, but before overcoating. Ground cable included is 40 inches. Includes 25 feet of 1 inch wide conductive tape. Use at least 1 ground per 1000 sq ft of painted surface. For interior use only.
			Click Here for complete grounding instructions (.pdf)
			
			Important note about conductive paint and the National Electric Code: 
			There is nothing in the NEC which prohibits painting your walls with conductive paint. However, because this product does NOT carry a UL listing, some electrical inspectors, by virtue of being the “Authority Having Jurisdiction” can require the homeowner to hire an electrical engineer to certify that the product is safe to connect to the electrical ground. They can also require that a licensed electrician perform the ground connection. If your application requires an electrical inspection AFTER installation, you should check with your local inspector BEFORE you proceed to avoid any surprises.

		Tested to Department of State Standard SD-STD-01.01 Rev. G (Amended), Ross High Security Steel Doors combine DOS certified ballistic and forced-entry resistance with advanced materials and finishes to provide elevated threat protection and striking contemporary appeal. The “05” models are tested to withstand simulated ”mob” attack for 5 minutes. The “15R” models are tested to withstand 15 minutes of simulated “mob” attack and are also resistant to 5.56 M193, 5.56 M855 and 7.62 M80 ballistic rounds.
